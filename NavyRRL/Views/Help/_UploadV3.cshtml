		<h3>Help: Uploading RMTL Data</h3>
		<p>This tool enables you to upload RMTL spreadsheets to create source data for the system. This source data can then be searched, filtered, and used for various purposes, including generating other RMTL spreadsheets.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h4>Upload Process Overview</h4>
		<p class="withBelow">The upload process is made up of 3 main phases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Providing the source RMTL data as a CSV file</li>
			<li>Processing and correcting the data</li>
			<li>Saving the finalized data</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h4>Phase 1: Providing the Source RMTL Data as a CSV File</h4>
		<p>You will need to provide the RMTL spreadsheet data as a CSV file.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Ensure that your file includes all relevant <b>NAVSTD</b>/<b>All Sailors</b> tasks.</p>
		<p class="withBelow">If your data is in a <b>Microsoft Excel</b> spreadsheet:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open the spreadsheet in Excel.</li>
			<li>Ensure there is only one tab in the spreadsheet. This is to avoid an issue with the way Excel converts spreadsheets with multiple tabs into CSV files.</li>
			<li>Click on the <b>File</b> header in the top-left of the taskbar.</li>
			<li>Click either <b>Save As</b> or <b>Save a Copy</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
			<li>From the <b>Save As Type</b> drop-down menu, select the <b>CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)</b> option if available; otherwise, select the <b>CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)</b> option.</li>
			<li>Click the <b>Save</b> button.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="withBelow">If your data is in a <b>Google Sheet</b> or similar cloud/browser-based spreadsheet:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open the spreadsheet in the web interface.</li>
			<li>Click on the <b>File</b> header in the top-left of the taskbar.</li>
			<li>From the <b>Download</b> submenu, click the <b>Comma Separated Values (.csv)</b> option.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h4>Phase 2: Processing and Correcting the Data</h4>
		<p>Once you provide the data, the system will process it to look for issues. You will need to correct the issues before moving on. This phase may need to be repeated several times to catch all of the issues.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> No data is saved to the database during this phase.</p>
		<p class="withBelow">To process the data:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select the appropriate Rating from the drop-down list below.</li>
			<li>Click <b>Choose File</b> and select the CSV file you created in Phase 1.</li>
			<li>Click the <b>Process</b> button.</li>
			<li>The system will begin processing the files. Once processing has completed, a report will be generated. Review the report.</li>
			<li><b>Server Errors:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Server errors are a result of unexpected data causing a problem that the system does not know how to handle. If there are any server errors, contact the administrator.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Processing Errors:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Processing errors occur when the data fails to meet one or more of the validation checks in place. Processing errors invalidate the processing of one or more rows, and therefore must be fixed in order to ensure the entire RMTL spreadsheet contains valid data. For this reason, if there are any processing errors, you will not be able to save the data to the database.</li>
				<li>The generated report will indicate which row(s) contain processing errors as well as the nature of each error.</li>
				<li>Review all processing errors generated by the system. Make the necessary correction(s) in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
				<li>Common errors include typos or unintended characters leading to certain controlled vocabulary terms ("Concepts") not being found in the data.</li>
				<li>If a new Concept needs to be added to the database, contract the administrator.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Warnings:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Warnings occur when the system identifies data that is potentially unintentional, such as changes to the text of an existing task, extraneous whitespace (such as double spaces or line breaks), or other issues that may lead to poor data quality.</li>
				<li>The generated report will indicate which row(s) contain warnings as well as the nature of each warning.</li>
				<li>Review all warnings generated by the system. If a warning represents data that needs to be corrected, make the correction(s) in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
				<li>If a warning refers to an intentional change or aspect of the data, you may ignore that warning for that row.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Messages:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>The system may generate additional miscellaneous messages. Review each message and determine whether or not it represents a change that needs to be made. If any such changes are identified, make the changes in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Potential Duplicates:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>The system attempts to identify potentially duplicated objects based on the available data. This may lead to false positives in some cases, so treat potential duplicates as you would treat warnings.</li>
				<li>Details for each potential duplicate can be found in the <b>Potential Duplicates</b> tab below. The generated report will indicate which row(s) contain potential duplicates, as well as the nature of each potential duplicate.</li>
				<li>Review each potential duplicate and determine whether any items represent unintended duplicates.</li>
				<li>Make the necessary corrections in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
				<li>If a potential duplicate refers to intentionally similar or identical items, you may ignore that set of potential duplicates.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>New Items:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>The system attempts to identify new items based on the available data and the existing items in the database.</li>
				<li>Details for each new item can be found in the <b>New Items</b> tab below.</li>
				<li>Review the new items and ensure the system correctly interpreted the spreadsheet's data.</li>
				<li>If any corrections need to be made, make them in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Additions to Existing Items:</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>the system attempts to update existing items in the database with newly-identified relationships to other items (either new or existing) as indicated by the RMTL spreadsheet.</li>
				<li>Details for each addition to each existing item can be found in the <b>Additions to Existing Items</b> tab below.</li>
				<li>Review the additions to existing items and ensure the system correctly interpreted the spreadsheet's data.</li>
				<li>If any corrections need to be made, make them in the RMTL spreadsheet and re-process the data.</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

	<div class="section">
		<h4>Phase 3: Saving the Finalized Data</h4>
		<p>Once all errors and warnings have been handled, and you have reviewed the entire report to ensure that the system correctly interpreted the spreadsheet's data, you may now save the data.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Once changes to the database have been saved, they can only be changed by staff with appropriate access.</p>
		<p class="withBelow">To save the data:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Click the <b>Confirm and Save Changes</b> button.</li>
			<li>Depending on the number of rows in the RMTL sheet, saving the data may take several minutes.</li>
			<li>Once the data has been saved, a final report will be generated. Review this report for any issues that occurred during the saving process.</li>
			<li>If there were any issues during the saving process, follow the recommended steps or contact the administrator.</li>
		</ol>
